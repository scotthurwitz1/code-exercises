DS&A exercise: 

Part 1: Sorting Arrays

Develop a program that asks the user to enter a capital for a U.S. state. Upon receiving the user input, the program reports 
whether the user input is correct. For this application, the 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array 
in order by state name. Display the current contents of the array then use a bubble sort to sort the content by capital. Next, 
prompt the user to enter answers for all the state capitals and then display the total correct count. The user's answer is not case-sensitive.

Part 2: Sorting & Searching HashMap

Now revise the code to store the pairs of each state and its capital in a Map using the HashMap function. Display the content of the Map, 
then use the TreeMap class to sort the map while using a binary search tree for storage. Next, your program should prompt the user to enter a 
state and it should then display the capital for the state.
